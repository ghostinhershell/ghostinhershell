## 1. Introduction ##
Hey guys, my name is Sarto Jama. Here are some facts about me:
- My first name, Sarto, means sprout üå± and my last name, Jama, means cooperation of the collective.
- I was born and raised in Atlanta, GA. I've spent my whole life living here.
- I've got a proud 8 year old that's full of personality
- My parents immigrated here from Ethiopia, and lived here for some time before I was born.
- I was an avid gamer growing up, loved JRPGs
- I worked at a company called Knack for almost 6 years of my career. Wore many hats, learned so much. Will always be a proud Knacklehead!
- Turning 30 made me realize that I didn't take enough risks or really live in my 20s. So I'm making up for that now by trying #allthethings!
  - So far this year I've become a hiker, gardener, community volunteer, a kayaker, tried archery, went camping, learned to grow mushrooms, climbed 3 local mountains, painted a mural, traveled out the country (Viva la Mexico üá≤üáΩ), changed jobs, grew closer to my Muslim faith and a bunch of other things I'm sure I'm forgetting üòÖ
- I'm small enough to where, if I'm with a group of kids, you'll easily assume I'm one of them.
- The way I hold pencils/pens when I write is unusual. People always comment on it.

## 2. How I Like to Work ##
My preference here is somewhere down the middle. I enjoy collaboative, async work. Basically, I enjoy projects where I have the opportunity to both work together with my teammates on a face to face basis while also being given the opportunity to do solo work so that I can have time with my own thoughts as well.

## 3. Communication ##
I'm definitely a Slack person, I'll get the notification both on my laptop and on my phone. Got anything for me, a quick message or need some eyes on something? Tag me ot DM me on Slack.

## 4. Feedback ##
I'm a bit of a perfectionist that's working on letting go of that so I've learned to actually enjoy recieving feedback. I see it as people you trust having your back by letting you know where you can improve. That was a big mindset shift for me since it meant that I *didn't* have to know it all or hold myself to critical standards. With that being said, if I had to choose a preference, I like reciving feedback via text/a message so that I can process what's being written and ask clarifying questions.

## 5. Support ##
Share how people can help you and how you can help other people. If you have any particular strengths or weaknesses, this is the section to add them to. When it comes to weaknesses, try to make it about personal growth‚Äîinstead of stating that you‚Äôre bad at something, say that you would like to improve in that specific area.

## 6. Favorites ##
- **Favorite quote:** "‚ÄúIt is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming." - Teddy Roselvelt
